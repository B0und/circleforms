This is a google forms inspired project adopted for an integration with a rythm game called osu!. 
Below is a showcase of some of the features i've built in collaboration with the team.

## Form creation

Probably the most challenging part of this application, managing complex dynamic state of multiple question types, with arbitrary number of options + the questions can change from one type to another one.

## Form submission

When you first create the form, it is made in a draft format, so you can continue editing it, until you want to actually publish it.
